# Simple Bot Control
This project offers a simple and easy way to manage microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP, and others, whether you're using one or multiple devices. It works by creating a server that, leveraging the Firmata protocol, maintains communication with your board. It then makes a dashboard available on your local network, accessible from the browser of any connected device.
